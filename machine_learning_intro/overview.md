# 1. Workshop Overview 

**Approach:** Know what Machine Learning is to generate an analytical perspective of everyday phenomena, being able to detect possible technology applications to develop solutions to common problems.

The workshop is designed in a way that you can aply the topics covered at the beginning of the session to a concrete problem. All sessions will follow the next order: 

        * 45 minutes of theory and examples
        * 45 minutes solving a problem

The idea is to work on the same project every session so that you can develop a complete data science product at the end of the workshop.

## The problem

I tried to find a data set with the following characteristics:

    * Useful to apply all the concepts covered in the workshop
    * Interesting to the majority of you
    * Highly informative even if you don't care about the topic
    * Helped me to keep you awake and comming

We'll use the **Google Play Store Apps** Dataset, which might be useful for people who are interested in technology and business development. The dataset can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/data). Please [download the dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w33rwi2ei9q4h3w/google-play-store-apps.zip?dl=0) to be able to follow each session's practical part.







# 2. The Big Picture About Data Science

## 80% Of the Work

## Machine Learning is part of the remaining 20%!!

The first sessions will focus on the first stages of the process, It makes no sense to understand what Machine learning is when the previous steps are not clear. This workshop will follow a logic pipeline just as if we were going to prepare 

# 3. What is Machine Learning

Computational methods to learn from data with the ultimate purpose of producing rules that improve the performance of a specific task or decision making process. (Felipe Gonz√°lez)

* We will only focus in **Supervised Learning** which consists on predicting or estimating a variable response from input data, and in **Unsupervised Learning** which describes interesting structures into data where there's not necessarily a response to predict. 

### Examples of Machine Learning Tasks:


* Predict if a client will default on a payment.
* Hand-written notes recognition.
* Detect whale sound recorded by buoys.
* Estimate monthly household incomes from geographic location and personal belongings.
* Classify Netflix clients according to the movies they like

#### Reasons why we would like to solve this issues through computational methods:

* We want to obtain cheap, quick, automatic and accurate solution.
* We want to outperform the current performance of experts on the topic or of simple rules using data.
* It's an interesting way to learn deeper characteristics of the Data we are analyzing.
