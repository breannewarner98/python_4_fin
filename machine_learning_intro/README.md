# Machine Learning Intro

**Objective:** Make you understand basic concepts about Machine Learning using Python 3.6 work so you can realize what to look for in official documentation or online.

This workshop is a 10-week course, designed for people familiar with Python 3.6. The objective of the course is to provide you with a basic overview of what Machine Learning is and how can it be applied to financial situations. After taking the course you should be able to understand the basis of machine learning, recognize some of its applications in business, get involved in the development of analytical solutions and develop automatic programs of valuations and price forecasts.
